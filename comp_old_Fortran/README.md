## Compile the module first before use it
Now it seems so easy, but actually there is a time I don't know how to use it.

It's better to write a `makefile`. Keep you avoiding from hitting repeated commands, save your time when you run the program. So you let the `script` do the heavy lifting, It's natural to think there is a  possibility that machine can write program too, because from a certain perspective, many program is heavy lifting too.

Now I got a feeling things were different from what I thought at the beginning, a program need to maintain even it works well at the first time.
