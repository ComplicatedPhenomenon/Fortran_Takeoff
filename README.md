## Practice repository

This repository will conclude the basic contents Fortran. Just a tutorial for a beginner, the effort you have taken is far from being a master. :smirk:

> To get good at anything you have to practice every day, and eventually it'll be easier and fun. :neutral_face:

Even if I heard about it long ago, I haven't done it.

> People hearing without listening.

> If you break the problem down into small exercises and lessons, and do them every day, you can learn to do almost anything. If you focus on slowly improving and enjoying the learning process, then you will benefit no matter how good you are at it.
