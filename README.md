# Practice repository

This repository will conclude the basic contents Fortran. So far, It's all about
example usage. Just as tutorial for a beginner.  :smirk:

> To get good at anything you have to practice every day, and eventually it'll be easier and fun. :neutral_face:

Even if I heard about it long ago, I haven't done it.

> People hearing without listening.

> If you break the problem down into small exercises and lessons, and do them every day, you can learn to do almost anything. If you focus on slowly improving and enjoying the learning process, then you will benefit no matter how good you are at it.



# An idea
* Coding with modern Fortran features.

* Spending time on program design instead of getting a head start in coding first.

* Perfect this repository until it become well tested and useful subprograms.

# Learn from curly selected project.
* 2acos0
* DiffusionMonteCarlo
* for-science
They all can be found on Github.
