### fortran_practise

this repo included some basic exercises, I'm tring to make it neat.It still seem hard for me.

>  * I know that to get good at anything you have to practice every day, even if I suck that day (which is often) or it's difficult.Keep trying and eventually it'll be easier and fun.*

>  * If you break the problem down into small exercises and lessons, and do them every day, you can learn to do almost anything. If you focus on slowly improving and enjoying the learning process, then you will benefit no matter how good you are at it.*
