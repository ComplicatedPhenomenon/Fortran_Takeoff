:sad: I did efforts to write a program completely in Modern Fortran, I failed

* -main.f90 is main program
* -fxn.f90 was written in a elegant way at least from my understanding
* -MC_VEGAS from [Hus-Sheng Shao](http://helac-phegas.web.cern.ch/helac-phegas/helac-onia.html), it was inherited from VEGAS written in FORTRAN77, but a modern form. It is reliable
* -CT14Pdf.f90 was generated by a  [Online F77 to F90 converter ](https://fortran.uk/plusfortonline.php)

**NOTE** Compile these independent unit first. May be giving a MakeFile would be great, I don't know how to write it yet.

**The problem got me stuck is** too many similar mistakes

```sh
Error: Global name 'partonx12' at (1) is already being used as a FUNCTION at (2)
CT14Pdf.f90:653.25:
    Included at fxn.f90:86:
    Included at main.f90:27:

       SUBROUTINE POLINT4F(Xa,Ya,X,Y)
	                 1
CT14Pdf.f90:653.25:
    Included at main.f90:26:

      SUBROUTINE POLINT4F(Xa,Ya,X,Y)
```
So `CT14pdf.f90` is difficult to work with just like  the caution I got.
