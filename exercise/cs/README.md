I'm stuck again. `MC_VEGAS.f90` and `CT14Pdf.for` both are  given programs. I only write `FXN.f90` and `MAIN.f90`. I don't know how the mistakes come into being except checking again and again 

Gladly there is no unclear problem, no basic level mistakes.

Then the problems become less obvious, I print out the intermediate variables, no obvious mistakes have been found.
