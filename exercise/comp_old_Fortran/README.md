**compile the module first before use it** , now it seems so easy, but actually there is a time I don't know how to use it.

It's better to write a **makefile**. Keep you avoiding from repeated commands, save time when you run the program. So you let the `script` do the heavy lifting, It's natural to think there is a  possibility that machine can write program too, because from a certain perspective, many program is heavy lifting too.

Now I got a feeling things were different from what I thought at the beginning, a program need to maintain even it works well at the first time.

Vital Mission: *pass `A` from a procedure into `FXN.f90`*

`FXN.f90` is not worse than `fxn.f90`, but I learned a lot from it , `problem_model_*.f90` is proof
