This project is to calculate the process of $q\bar{q}\rightarrow t\bar{t}G_n$

`Framework of code`

* `MC_VEGAS.f90` is the key algorithm for multiple integration in the phase space. Borrow from [HELAC-Onia](https://archive.org/details/arxiv-1212.5293)
* `FXNqq.f90` is for final state of three body phase space integration.
* `MAINqq.f90` is the main program.
  * The cross section are calculated as a function of $M_D$. 
* Citing `CT14pdf.for` and `CT14.pds` from [CT14 parton distribution functions](http://hep.pa.msu.edu/cteq/public/index.html) of its General-purpose LO central sets  
* `buildqq.sh` is a simple makefile.
* `loop.sh` is a script for controlling the loop outside of main program.
* `graph.py` is used to plot with the outcome.

`FortranForm` of results generated by `mathematica`  will introduce `\` which won't be recognized when being called in the Fortran program. Use `:%s/\\/\&/g`, `%s/$/\&/g`, `%g/&&/\&/g` and other command to modify the results.
* [vim Tips](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Ranges)
  * [Delete all lines containing a pattern ](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Delete_all_lines_containing_a_pattern)
  * Change variable name in the whole program, naming it in a more readable way. `:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc` Change only whole words exactly matching `foo` to `bar`; ask for confirmation.
