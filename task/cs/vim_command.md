* Change variable name in the whole program, naming it in a more readable way. `:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc` Change only whole words exactly matching `foo` to `bar`; ask for confirmation. 

* `FortranForm` of results generated by `mathematica`  will introduce `\` which won't be recognized when being called in the Fortran program. Use `:%s/\\/\&/g`, `%s/$/\&/g`, `%g/&&/\&/g` and other command to modify the results.
