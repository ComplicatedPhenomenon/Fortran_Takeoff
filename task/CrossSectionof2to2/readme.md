Master's thesis to calculate the process of $p\bar{p}\rightarrow t\bar{t}G_n$

`Framework of code`

* `MC_VEGAS.f90` is the key algorithm for multiple integration in the phase space. Borrow from [HELAC-Onia](https://archive.org/details/arxiv-1212.5293)
* `FXN*.f90` is for final state of three body phase space integration.
* `MAIN*.f90` is the main program.
* Citing `CT14pdf.for` and `CT14.pds` from [CT14 parton distribution functions](http://hep.pa.msu.edu/cteq/public/index.html) of its General-purpose LO central sets  
* `build*.sh` is to generate the executable file.
* `loop.sh` is a script call that executable file.
* `notebooks` contains the Jupyter Notebook for  analysing and displaying the outcome.

`FortranForm` of results generated by `mathematica`  will introduce `\` which won't be recognized when being called in the Fortran program. Use `:%s/\\/\&/g`, `%s/$/\&/g`, `%g/&&/\&/g` and other command to modify the results.

  * Change variable name in the whole program, naming it in a more readable way. `:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc` Change only whole words exactly matching `foo` to `bar`; ask for confirmation.

* [Parse a plain text file into a CSV file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16248513/parse-a-plain-text-file-into-a-csv-file-using-python)
  * Turning text file into CSV makes it convenient to manipulate the file.
* Merge four files into one: `cat bingos1.m bingos2.m bingos3.m bingos4.m > bingo.m`
